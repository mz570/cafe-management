// This is the main class for the Cafe Management System. It initializes the application by creating an instance of the LoginFrame class, which handles user authentication and role-based access to the system's features. The system is designed to manage various aspects of a cafe, including inventory, sales, and employee management. The LoginFrame class is responsible for displaying the login interface and validating user credentials before granting access to the main dashboard based on the user's role (admin or employee).
// The main method serves as the entry point for the application, ensuring that the login process is initiated when the program is run. The system is built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface, providing a user-friendly experience for cafe management tasks.
